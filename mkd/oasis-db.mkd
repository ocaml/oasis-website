## What is OASIS-DB ##

This sub-project aims to create a [CPAN][] for OCaml in OCaml. It relies on the
metadata contained in the `_oasis` files that must be contained in the tarball
of a project.

 [CPAN]: http://www.cpan.org/

The project manages packages, which are sets of versioned tarballs of the same
project. For example, the package `ounit` is the set of tarballs
`ounit-1.0.1.tar.gz`, `ounit-1.0.2.tar.gz` and `ounit-1.0.3.tar.gz`. Each
tarball must contain a `_oasis` file which describes its content. 

You can upload a tarball for a package directly on our [website][] or on the 
[sandbox website][]. It is then checked for a valid `_oasis` file and published. 

  [website]: http://oasis.ocamlcore.org
  [sandbox website]: http://oasis.ocamlcore.org/dev/home

Once uploaded, a notification is sent through the website RSS feed. You can
download the new tarball using a command line tool or directly from the website.
If build dependencies are also published on the website, you have a direct link 
to it on the package's web page and can download it as well.

For now this sub-project is at the early development stage. You can get the
[technical specifications][] to see what is planned. You can also look at our 
[website prototype][].

This project is a joint effort of [Jane Street][] and [OCamlCore][].

## Features ##

 * __Reduce the paperwork to publish a new version of your package.__

   Just upload a tarball to the website. OASIS-DB creates a web page, provide a
   download link and publish an RSS feed aggregated on [OCaml planet][].

 * __Integrated library dependencies management.__

   OASIS-DB package's web page links to other published projects which are
   required to compile. We also use this feature to create "bundled" tarball
   that can integrate your project, its build dependencies and a script to
   compile everything.

 * __Backup website for package's tarball.__

   If possible the download link on the package's web page points to a place of
   your choice, but we also provide a backup of this tarball.

 * __Integration with [OCaml forge][].__

   If you publish a new version of your project in the forge with a `_oasis`
   file, it is automatically published through OASIS-DB. The login/password
   information of OASIS-DB website are shared with the forge.

 * __Integration with GODI and a [cabal-install][] like system.__

   To ease the publication of your project, OASIS-DB translates
   `_oasis` files into a GODI alternate repository. Since we also follow
   the track of [Cabal][], we provide a tool similar to [cabal-install][] as
   a proof of concept .

 * __Integration with LinkDB, The Hump.__

   We will cooperate with these OCaml search engines, by publishing data in a
   format that allows them to easily reuse new version notification.

 * __Automatic tracking of off-site packages.__

   We use [uscan][] and [DEHS][] ideas to get your package directly from your
   website. If you are already hosted on github, Google Code or SourceForge, you
   can create an action that will check for new upstream releases directly on these
   website and publish them automatically on OASIS-DB.

 * __Interaction through an API and a command line tools.__

  OASIS-DB is a website and a sub-system of OASIS. The website provide an API to
  manage packages. This API is used by the command line interface to publish and
  download packages from the website.

## Technical details ##

When we built OASIS, we choose to copy the architecture of [Cabal][]. Cabal is
the foundation of [HackageDB][] which is a kind of CPAN for Haskell. This
sub-project will follow the same path, we will copy what has been done with
[HackageDB][].

Moreover, we use this project as a demonstration of other important OCaml
projects:

 * The website is an [Ocsigen][] application
 * We use [sexplib][] to serialize plugin's data
 * We use OASIS to provide information about packages
